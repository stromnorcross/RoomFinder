### Description:

Find classrooms across UVA's campus through 
the built-in Google Maps feature and reserve a room 
for a quiet study spot, project meeting, or
anything in between. This application takes into account
when classes are occuring, so users are unable to book 
during specified class times.

Project was built using the Django Framework,
Bootstrap, and Google Maps API. 

Currently, RoomFinder is hosted on Heroku. To view the website click here: https://room-finder1-70d4c0df9a64.herokuapp.com/
